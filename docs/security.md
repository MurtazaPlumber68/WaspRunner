# WasmRunner Security Model

## Overview

WasmRunner implements a defense-in-depth security model with multiple layers of isolation and protection. The goal is to safely execute untrusted WASM code while maintaining system security and stability.

## Threat Model

### Assumptions
- **Untrusted Code**: WASM modules may be malicious or buggy
- **Trusted Runtime**: The WasmRunner binary itself is trusted
- **Secure Host**: The host operating system provides basic security primitives

### Threats
1. **Code Execution Attacks**: Malicious WASM attempting system compromise
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: DoS through excessive CPU, memory, or I/O usage
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to host filesystem or network
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Attempts to gain higher system privileges
5. **Covert Channels**: Information leakage through timing or resource usage

## Security Layers

### Layer 1: WASM Sandboxing
WebAssembly provides the first layer of security through its design:

- **Memory Safety**: No buffer overflows or use-after-free bugs
- **Control Flow Integrity**: No arbitrary jumps or ROP attacks
- **Type Safety**: Static verification of all operations
- **Capability-Based Security**: Explicit imports for all external functionality

### Layer 2: Runtime Isolation
The WASM runtime provides additional isolation:

```rust
// Example seccomp configuration
pub struct SeccompConfig {
    pub allowed_syscalls: Vec<&'static str>,
    pub blocked_syscalls: Vec<&'static str>,
    pub default_action: SeccompAction,
}

impl Default for SeccompConfig {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            allowed_syscalls: vec![
                "read", "write", "close", "exit", "exit_group"
            ],
            blocked_syscalls: vec![
                "execve", "fork", "clone", "ptrace", "mount"
            ],
            default_action: SeccompAction::Errno(EPERM),
        }
    }
}
```

### Layer 3: OS-Level Controls
Operating system primitives provide additional security:

#### Linux Namespaces
- **PID Namespace**: Process isolation
- **Network Namespace**: Network isolation (optional)
- **Mount Namespace**: Filesystem isolation
- **User Namespace**: UID/GID mapping

#### Seccomp-BPF Filtering
- Syscall allowlisting/denylisting
- Parameter validation
- Fine-grained control over system interactions

#### Cgroups (Control Groups)
- Memory limits and OOM handling
- CPU quotas and scheduling
- I/O bandwidth limits
- Device access controls

### Layer 4: Resource Management
Prevent resource exhaustion attacks:

```rust
pub struct ResourceLimits {
    pub memory_bytes: u64,
    pub cpu_percent: u32,
    pub execution_time_seconds: u64,
    pub file_descriptors: u32,
    pub network_connections: u32,
}
```

## Security Policies

### Default Security Profile
- **Memory Limit**: 128MB maximum
- **CPU Limit**: 100% of single core
- **Network Access**: Disabled by default
- **Filesystem Access**: Read-only, limited paths
- **Execution Time**: 5 minute maximum

### Custom Security Profiles
Users can define custom security profiles:

```toml
# security-profile.toml
[memory]
limit_mb = 256
enable_guard_pages = true

[cpu]
limit_percent = 50
nice_value = 10

[network]
allow_outbound = false
allowed_hosts = []

[filesystem]
read_only = true
allowed_paths = ["/tmp", "/var/lib/app"]
```

## Cryptographic Security

### Image Signing
- Ed25519 signatures for image integrity
- Chain of trust from publisher to runtime
- Signature verification before execution

### Secure Communication
- TLS 1.3 for registry communication
- Certificate pinning for known registries
- Encrypted credential storage

## Audit and Monitoring

### Security Events
All security-relevant events are logged:
- Container creation and termination
- Resource limit violations
- Seccomp policy violations
- Network access attempts
- Filesystem access patterns

### Metrics and Alerting
- Resource usage monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Security violation alerting
- Performance degradation detection

## Security Testing

### Fuzzing
- Continuous fuzzing of WASM parser
- Syscall interface fuzzing
- Input validation fuzzing
- Resource exhaustion testing

### Penetration Testing
- Regular security assessments
- Container escape attempts
- Privilege escalation testing
- Data exfiltration prevention

### Static Analysis
- Rust clippy with security lints
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code review requirements
- Automated security testing in CI

## Incident Response

### Security Vulnerabilities
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Mitigation**: Deploy temporary workarounds
3. **Fix Development**: Create permanent solution
4. **Testing**: Verify fix effectiveness
5. **Deployment**: Roll out security update
6. **Communication**: Notify users and community

### Emergency Response
- Automated container termination on policy violation
- Immediate resource cleanup
- Audit trail preservation
- Incident reporting and analysis

## Compliance Considerations

### Standards Alignment
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Controls
- ISO 27001 requirements
- SOC 2 Type II compliance

### Regulatory Requirements
- GDPR data protection
- HIPAA for healthcare applications
- SOX for financial systems
- FedRAMP for government use
